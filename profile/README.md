## PHPolar ðŸ–¤ PHP

Use **PHP** to configure the powerful dependency injection system.

Don't want to learn a templating language? Already know a templating language or 2 but you just want to stay in PHPland while you're developing? Just use PHP. It's already a great templating language. You can use the **PurePHP** library for your templates. Automatic XSS mitigation is included. Still want to use another templating language? No problem and no adapters required. Just plug it into the dependency injection configuration and you're all set!

## PHPolar ðŸ–¤ Freedom

PHPolar wants to enable rapid development while still giving you the freedom to decide which libraries you want to integrate into your application. PHPolar stays out of your way.

## PHPolar ðŸ–¤ Easy

Like copying and pasting code? Go for it! Want to try out PHPolar? Just use the code in the example. By modifying a few values and replacing a dependency here and there, you'll see how quick and easy it is to get a project up and running.
